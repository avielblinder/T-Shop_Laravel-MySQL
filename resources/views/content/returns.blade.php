            <h4> T-SHOP POLICY</h4>
             <p>   Returns must be accompanied by original or gift receipt, or date and amount of purchase must be validated in our system. Customer identification may be required solely for the purpose of preventing fraud. We reserve the right to refuse or limit returns or exchanges for any reason. In the event we elect to honor a refund or exchange without proof of purchase, we will exchange merchandise or issue a merchandise credit based on the lowest historical selling price for the returned merchandise when factoring in all promotions, discounts, offers, free items (as part of a qualifying purchase) and coupons that may have applied. You will be limited to $250 in non-receipted returns within a 90 day period (excluding defective merchandise). Refunds will be made in the original form of payment, except that merchandise credit may be given for gift receipt returns. If you used multiple forms of payment, refunds will be applied in the following order (as applicable): (i) merchandise cards/gift cards; (ii) credit cards; (iii) check; (iv) cash. If your original purchase was made by check, you may choose to receive a merchandise card, or a check will be mailed within 30 days of return. Merchandise must be in its original condition, unworn and unwashed, or merchandise must be defective. Swimwear, watches, intimates and hosiery may be returned when unworn and in original packaging or with original ticketing attached and sanitary shields (if any) attached; we do not accept returns for soiled or washed merchandise. In the event that we elect to honor a refund without original ticketing, the refund will be issued in the form of a merchandise card. Merchandise purchased in an outlet store may only be returned in such locations. Merchandise purchased in a full-priced store or on a full-priced website may only be returned in such locations. Purchases must be returned in the country of original purchase. Product purchased online via BorderFree may only be returned online. Merchandise purchased via PayPal may be returned in stores or returned via mail using the return shipping label provided. If you do not have your shipping label, please contact Customer Service. Shipping and handling charges on your purchase, if any, are non-refundable. Merchandise purchased in airport or cruise locations may only be returned at the original location; such locations cannot accept merchandise returns from our other stores or websites.</p>
